Doing this assignment, the engines acted all very similar. They all have a docking panel layout, with scene view, assets, heirarchy, and details panel. Importing was a simple drag and drop. For Godot and Unity I had to manually add the texture, but I didn't need to remake any materials or anything. However, for godot I did have to reimport all the assets, but that was just one button click.


In terms of building the scene, they were also very similar. I could simply drag and drop the assets into the scene view and then use transform, rotate, and scale widgets to move the objects. All 3 engines have a hierarchical scheme, so you can simply drag objects onto each other in the hierarchy to create parents. In Godot, there is no difference between components and gameobjects/actors, but for this use case there was not really a difference. The mesh nodes didn’t even show up in the hierarchy, since they were packed scenes. 


I would pick Unity if I had to make the level again, simply because im most comfortable with it. With this work the work is nearly identical. Unreal has automatic snapping with its widgets which is nice but in my experience that can be annoying as many times as it is helpful.
